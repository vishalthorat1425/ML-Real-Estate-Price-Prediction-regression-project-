# ML-Real-Estate-Price-Prediction-regression-project

In this machine learning project, we aim to predict real estate prices using regression techniques. The project is developed using Python as the primary programming language and leverages various libraries such as Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning, Matplotlib for data visualization, and Sklearn for model building.


1)Utilized Python for real estate price prediction using regression techniques.
2)Employed Numpy and Pandas for effective data cleaning and preprocessing.
3)Visualized data patterns and relationships using Matplotlib for insightful analysis.
4)Built regression models with Sklearn, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
5)Compared model performance using evaluation metrics such as MSE and RMSE.
6)Deployed the best-performing model for making real estate price predictions.
7)Developed the project in Jupyter notebook and PyCharm for efficient code development and experimentation.
